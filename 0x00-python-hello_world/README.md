# 0x00. Python - Hello, World

This repository contains solutions to a series of programming tasks related to Python programming. The tasks are designed to help you understand and practice various concepts in Python programming. Each task involves writing Python scripts to accomplish specific goals.

## Project Overview
This project is part of a second chance opportunity to demonstrate Python programming skills. The project started on August 7, 2023, and must be completed by August 10, 2023. An auto review will be launched at the deadline to evaluate the solutions.

## Concepts
This project expects you to be familiar with the following concept:
- Python programming

## Resources
Before proceeding with the tasks, it's recommended to review the following resources:
- The Python tutorial (first three chapters)
- Whetting Your Appetite
- Using the Python Interpreter
- An Informal Introduction to Python (up to "3.1.2. Strings")
- How To Use String Formatters in Python 3
- Learn to Program
- Pycodestyle â€“ Style Guide for Python Code

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without using external resources:
- General understanding of why Python programming is awesome
- Knowledge of Python's creator
- Familiarity with Guido van Rossum
- Understanding the origin of the name 'Python'
- Knowledge of the Zen of Python
- Using the Python interpreter
- Printing text and variables using `print`
- Working with strings
- Understanding indexing and slicing in Python
- Knowledge of the official Python coding style and using `pycodestyle`

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the repo, describing the repository
- Your code should use `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*) for style checking
- All files must be executable
- File lengths will be tested using `wc`

## Tasks
