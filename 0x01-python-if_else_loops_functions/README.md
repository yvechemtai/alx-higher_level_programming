# Project: Python - if/else, loops, functions

## Overview
Welcome to the advanced tasks of the Python project! In this project, you will be working on various programming exercises to enhance your understanding of control flow, functions, and loops in Python. These tasks are designed to help you reinforce your Python skills and improve your problem-solving abilities.

## Project Details
- **Author**: Guillaume $ Yve Chemtai
- **Weight**: 1
- **Project Start**: Aug 8, 2023 6:00 AM
- **Project End**: Aug 10, 2023 6:00 AM
- **Auto QA Review**: A review will be launched at the deadline

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you are expected to have a solid grasp of the following concepts without needing to rely on external resources:

### General
- Understanding the awesomeness of Python programming.
- Recognizing the importance of indentation in Python.
- Using if and if...else statements effectively.
- Adding comments to code for better readability.
- Assigning values to variables and understanding their scope.
- Utilizing while and for loops.
- Distinguishing between Python's `for` loop and C's `for` loop.
- Using `break` and `continue` statements.
- Applying `else` clauses to loops.
- Understanding the purpose of the `pass` statement and when to use it.
- Working with the `range` function.
- Defining functions and using them effectively.
- Understanding the behavior of functions that don't use `return` statements.
- Grasping the concept of variable scope.
- Handling tracebacks.
- Working with arithmetic operators.

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
- Editors allowed: vi, vim, emacs.
- Code will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
- All files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- Code should follow the PEP 8 style guide (using pycodestyle version 2.8.*).
- All files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using the `wc` command.

### C Scripts
- Editors allowed: vi, vim, emacs.
- Code will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- All files should end with a new line.
- Code should adhere to the Betty style, which will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- Usage of global variables is not allowed.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- Prototypes of all functions should be included in the header file named `lists.h`.
- Don't forget to push your header file.
- All header files should be include guarded.

## Tasks
This project includes several tasks, each designed to enhance your understanding of various programming concepts. The tasks involve writing Python scripts and C scripts. For more details on each task, refer to the provided individual task files in the project directory.
